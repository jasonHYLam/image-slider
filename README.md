## What I've Learned

- Centering larger elements within smaller elements using left: 50% and transform: translate(-50%).
- Using setTimeOut and transition in order to start from a specific position, and animate to another position.
- Using setInterval to repeat an animation every 5 seconds.
- Smoothly interrupting the loop using clearInterval(myTimer), and reassigning the setInterval to myTimer.
- 'Moving' to a particular slide, by the difference between the previous slide's index and the current slide's index.
